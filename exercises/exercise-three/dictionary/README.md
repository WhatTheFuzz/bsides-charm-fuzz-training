# Dictionary

Poke around the `crasm` directory and look for good values to add to the
dictionary. Good places to look include any documentation files (`.md`, `.txt`,
`.html`). Extract key words that seem meaningful for the input.

Worried about adding too little or too much? Don't fret, it's difficult to get
this wrong. Using values from the dictionary is only one way the mutator in the
fuzzer generates inputs.

## Solution

If you're stuck, I've included an *example* of what values a good dictionary
might include in the file
[solution-dictionary.txt](./solution/dictionary-solution.txt).
